The Way Beyond
==============
An Overview of Spiritual Practices
----------------------------------

This is an out-of-print book made freely available online with the author's knowledge. This book is offered for free distribution. Please do not sell this book.

This is a book about what you should do, not about what you should believe. What you should do if you wish to maximize your potential; satisfy your basic yearnings; have peak experiences.

To accomplish all this, the author provides a practical overview of five spiritual practices to be used as guidelines: meditation, concentration, mindfulness, opening the heart, and reducing attachments.

Dr. Mikulas, author of _The Skills of Living_ focuses on what he calls "the game of life" and, he suggests, "have fun playing it the best you can." "The trick is to be able to continually play the game but not be lost in it . . . be 'in the world but not of it.' "
